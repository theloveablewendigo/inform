Most of them connect to the ocean, allowing enormous ships to dock and load up on supplies before heading out into the dark ocean.  Just like the park, it's silent and empty.

The open compartment has what appears to be... wooden sticks?  Or wands... seriously?  Seriously, freaking wands?  Welp, it has been a weird day.

The Palomino is or well... was awesome when you were a bit younger, and drinking copious amounts.  Its good to visit this old place again.&#x000A;&#x000A;An ex girlfriend of yours, the most beautiful liar you have ever known, it's at front of the bar in the Palomino.  You heard she took over this joint, but certainly didn't want to pursue a congratulations visit.&#x000A;&#x000A;Exits: southwest to Side Pass and west.&#x000A;&#x000A;Courtney is sitting at the bar.  Courtney.  Goddamnit, you had forgotten that another friend of yours had told you one of your ex's bought this place. Which was surprisingly empty, enough that Courtney of course turns and looks at you when you walk in.&#x000A;Courtney smirks "I sent all the others that came to my corral, but I guess the herd was missing one." before just turning and pulling down her jean shorts.&#x000A;Your simple mind was blown at the glimpse of (the very much fantasized about) soft, small lips of Courtneys, nested in between her thin thighs.  The soft pink entrance just barely noticeably covered in light-peach-hairs.. and twisting and changing, her juices spewing from it.  She archs her back, biting her lip as the the plump little clam that's her pussy starts to grow darker and even fatter, gaining in size to meet the size of a common breeding mare.  She lets out a audible "Oooooooh" as it winks for the first time, seeming to invite you to come shove your snout in it.&#x000A;&#x000A;The pussy you had craved so much, not knowing til now, was changing into the swollen needy cunt of a mare in heat.  In some amount of effort, Courtney craned her head to look at you, smiling at the sight of you under her spell, "Come get me, I've needed you again all this time.".  The end of the last sentence was her last as a human, shifting from her desperate begging to the whinny of a very reluctant breeding mare.&#x000A;&#x000A;One that you neeeeeded.  You catch yourself, stunned at the thought that snuck into your mi- OH MY GOD IT SMELLS AMAZING.  Your pants stirred, your vision stuck on the now complete pussy winking in front of you.  The scent, oh god, the scent of beautiful things, of happinnnneeess in physical form, you NEEEEEEEEEEEEIIGGHHH.  A whinny explodes from your mouth as the world spins a full ninety degrees, shaken from the terrifying fall by your front hooves landing on the firm ground.  You know somethings going on with your body, your mind or what... whatever it doesn't matter, as your nostrils have landed only inches away from the nervous mare in front of you.  Specifically, inches away from the squelching of her needy pussy.  You know it's Courtney, you know she doesn't want you to mate with her, and you don't care.  Her desperate struggles can't prevent you from jumping ontop her, your new stallion penis breaking out of its sheath to sink slowly, wetly into her guilty pleasure..  Her whinny of surprise hardly breaks you from your trance as you follow the rules of nature, fucking her so hard that she falls down on her front knees in desperate attempt to manage the massive strength of your thrusting.&#x000A;&#x000A;She's yours, you can feel it coming, you're claiiimminggggg NEEIEHGGHGGHHHHHHHHHHH.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;    *** The last thought fades from your mind as you impregnate the now mindless mare. Eventually you reluctantly pull out, knowing Courtney is ready to bear your young for the rest of her life.&#x000A;&#x000A;Game Over.

Wait a sec, they're all wearing ski masks..&#x000A;&#x000A;Exits: southwest to Upper Class Arts and north.&#x000A;&#x000A;One turns to seee you, shit!&#x000A;&#x000A;"HEY STOP THERE!" Plants shoot out of the ground, holding your feet to the ground.  Suddenly the crowd starts thinning in front of you, disappearing into nonexistence until just one remains. Well one, and what the illusions were looking at.. A poor woman.  The short haired girl has dyed hair, the color of blue, and is crying with all four of her limbs held to the ground with vines as well. The robed figure pulls back her hood to reveal... some sort of deer woman? What the hell is this?&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Press any key to continue ...</result>

"Jennifer" here thinks she is above us.  But she's going to be the perfect replacement, and very much one of us.  And I think you'll enjoy joining her.. she'll need a mate to give her a fawn to raise.&#x000A;&#x000A;With this statement the girl lets out a loud sob, struggling to escape the vines with no hope. "Please I'll do anything I don't want to be an animal" she begs the witch, who just ignores her. &#x000A;&#x000A;Press any key to continue ...</result>

Shes trying to crane her head to see what is happening, but a vine sprouts out from underneath her and turns her head forward. Oh crap... this isn't good.&#x000A;The sound of a car outside passing comes as a unexpected savior.  The witch freezes in the light beams as it drives past.  This is your chance to escape, or try to just "ride" this out.  Do you want to escape?</result>

    <result xml:space="preserve">Your cock is fully erect, it standing like a sideways flag pole out of your nethers. But its twitching, and darkening. You watch as the head of it disappears into its length, the feeling of warmth spreading from it. You can only gasp as the skin behind it bubbles and expands like a bloated... Breast? The breast skin holding your dick changes to the same color as it, your dick shrinking slightly in size as your balls disappear in the mammary mass. "Whyyyy?" Your ragged cry escapes your mouth at the sight of what you thought was still your dick multiplying into 3 more, the realization that you now have a few small teets sinking in. Brown fur erupts from the outside of your jiggling breasts tissue and starts to cover your widening ass. The area behind your utter is stirring, and from what you can feel growing warmer and wetter. "ohhhhhh" you moan as you can feel a tail wiggling above your ass, the warm feeling right below it and moving to meet with your butt hole.&#x000A;&#x000A;Suddenly you drop from the sky, landing nimbly on your hardening fingers. "Get her, Jennifer" the command from the witch causing you to jump, you had forgotten they were there.&#x000A;&#x000A;*SNIFF*&#x000A;&#x000A;the warmth behind you is being nuzzled by something, and its making you feel weird. Looking behind, you have just enough time to see the antlers of a stag before his tongue licks your warmth, sending a shockwave of pleasure through you.&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;Press any key to continue ...</result>

Please dooOOOOOOHH" The stag jumps on top of you, thrusting frustratingly at your doe pussy. You bleat, trying to get out from underneath him. His dick finally hits the target though.. But its your little doe asshole. He plows into it, causing you to cry out in a deerlike whimper. He starts fucking you like mad, the feeling of being mated with a new feeling for you. His balls keep slapping against your plump doe teets as one of his thrusts pull out far enough to plop out of your asshole, the next finding your vagina.&#x000A;&#x000A;He starts going to town again, what you can only assume as a shit covered deer dick pounding your pussy. You keep crying out in fear but you can feel something stirring inside of you. "Nooooooo" the bleat the closest to a human sound you can make as you piss yourself from the pleasurable humiliation. The stag thrusts all the way in, your eyes popping out of your head as the sudden move pushes you to cum on his hilted cock. You can feel his seed pumping inside of you, and you know you've been claimed. You bleat as he pulls out,exhausted, a squelching sound of your still wet pussy spewing out some of his cum. But its still too much, you know you're pregnant.&#x000A;&#x000A;The witch laughs at you, turning to leave you there to get raped by former Jennifer some more. "im going to leave you with your mind intact asshole," her last words to you putting terror into your heart, "i hope you enjoy deer dicks pounding you for the rest of your life, because that's all your gonna get.".&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;&#x000A;    *** Game Over.
